		<h3>Autorating system about page.</h3>
		<p>Made in one week with zero effort by one and a half person, this autoranking
		system can automatically differentiate players with the help of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elo_rating_system" alt="Wiki">Elo Rating system</a>.</p>

		<p>Every entry in the Autorating database holds unique publicly-signed hashes of
		profiles that cannot be faked and they represent the legitimacy of the profiles.
		The player's profile information (played games, wins, losses, total kills, total
		scores) is purely cosmetic and only for displaying the stars near the profile
		name. These info stats will not be used anywhere else because they can be easily
		edited by the user that holds the profile file.</p>

		<!-- <p>For the automatic results gathering, we are using an autohost instance of
		Warzone 2100 with an additional game patch (the .wz mod that's downloaded when
		you join the match) that allows it to automatically report finished research,
		profiles, unique player keys (needed for displaying the stats) and other match
		statistics. As it turned out, the single game patch isn't enough, and with the
		help of Vaut's spectator mod we can now host matches without any trouble and
		provide automatic win/loose detection, spectator support, additional logging and time limit.</p> -->

		<p>If you have ideas or suggestions in how to improve the current system or you
		found bugs in it, feel free to <a href="https://discord.com/users/343418440423309314/profile/">DM me in Discord</a> (Max#6717), join our <a href="https://warzone2100.pro">Teamspeak3
		voice server</a> or directly write to us in <a href="https://vk.com/1dontknow2/">VK</a>.</p>

		<h3>Details about win/loose state.</h3>
		<p>The current ranking system calculates single values that represents how good a
		player can play. We are using the stock Elo Rating system to make corrections of
		the player's Elo within each played match. To score a victory you need to win,
		and by *winning* we mean this: you need to get a win screen with unit statistics
		and all the other stuff, just like in the campaign mission complete. Otherwise,
		we cannot guarantee that you won the match. After getting the win/loose screen
		you can safely leave the match, the results being automatically saved.</p>

		<h3>Elo Rating calculations</h3>
		<p>For every player in encounter we are calculating probability of winning in this
		against this particular opponent by this forula (R is current Elo score of players):
		<img src=""><br>
		After calculating both probabilities we are correcting Elo by this formula:
		<img src=""><br>
		Where K is constant 20 and S is 0 or 1 depending on what player won.
		For each 10 minutes of survival, defeated player rewarded with 1 extra Elo point.</p>
		<!-- <p>You can calculate elo right now on <a href="">elo calculator page</a>.</p> -->

		<h3>Limitations and abuse attempts.</h3>
		<p>Any abuse attempts will be noticed, the match result may be deleted/fixed/recalculated,
		and most importantly: players (and potentially his IPs) attempted to fool ranking
		system could be blacklisted across all Autohosters. If you found an abuse method,
		contact us with detailed respective of exploit.</p>
		<p><b>Playing with more than single player profile is an abuse attempt! Any "alt" profile
		will be promtlessly merged into single one (most games, more familiar name or randomly)!</b><br>
		But, since system is based on hash values of profile, you can freely change your <b>name</b>
		by renaming .sta file. To simplify nickname change you can create multiple sta files
		containing same hash but with different names.</p>
		<p>To filter out spam-games or "double windowed" games Autohosters are collecting
		and checking data you sent in-game and if it notices that it is sure spam-game
		it will report the match and all players in it to Automaster for investigation.</p>
		<p>To prevent afk players, Vaut introduced activity tracking. If no activity from player
		for 3 minutes from game start detected - defeat is admitted. Actions are one of following:
		unit production, research completion, building construction, damage dealing.</p>
		<p>Keep in mind that Autorating does not (and will not) have strict nickname/profile
		rules, any insulting/racist/offensive nickname (in any language) will be changed to
		"Inappropriate nickname" once. If player will countinue play without changing it it will
		lead to blacklisting/ban. Also, don't think you can write to chat whatever you want, you
		can be muted or banned for intensive insulting.</p>
		<p>By entering Autohoster room you are promtlessly
		accepting Autorating rules.</p>
